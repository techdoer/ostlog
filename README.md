See the [family•smarts](http://familysmarts.net) website for real-world examples of generating insights from an ostlog-powered Personal Health Library to boost household growth, health and well-being. 

# principles
ostlog is based on the following principles:

	* every individual should own their medical, health and well-being related data
	* personal and confidential data should be protected and shared at the discretion of its owner 
	* self-tracking data and tools should be simple and accessible to all members of the family 
	* data collection tools should favor accuracy over the latest fancy gadgets 
	* data should ahere to established standards to facilitate interoperability 

# schema 
A JSON Schema defining a fully integrated self-tracking datamodel is available in the schema folder.   ostlog supports data collection across five dimensions of well-being.

# installation
ostlog can be deployed as a database in the cloud or locally on your computer.  

Local ostlog is a good option for those who prefer not to store confidential personal information in the cloud and is available as a  Microsoft Access 2013 database.  To start using local ostlog, simply clone/download the MS Access file from the ostlog GitHub repository and open it using Microsoft Access 2013 or later.  Once open, you will find sample tracking data for a fictitious family of five to help you get started. 

Cloud ostlog is designed for Microsoft Azure SQL Server.  This makes self-tracking data readily availble to the rich catalog of Azure-based data services including Azure Machine Learning Studio. A valid Microsoft Azure subscription is required for cloud ostlog.
