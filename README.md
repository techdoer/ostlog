# principles
ostlog is based on the following principles:

	* every individual should own their medical, health and well-being related data
	* personal and confidential data should be protected and shared at the discretion of its owner 
	* data and tools should be simple and accessible to all members of the family 
	* data collection should not wear you out; tools should favor accurate data over the fanciness of the latest gadgets 
	* data should be standardized to facilitate integration and interoperability where required
